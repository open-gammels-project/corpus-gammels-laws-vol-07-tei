<salute>An Act providing for the Condemnation and Sale of Land for Delinquent Taxes.</salute>

<p>Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Texas, That the Comptroller of Public Accounts of this State shall, immediately after the first day of Jan<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />uary, A. D. 1874, and every five years thereafter, make out a list of all delinquent taxes that are due and unpaid, with interest due thereon at such date, as shown by the records of his office, whether such taxes be general or special, State, or county, assessed on real property, which list shall contain such description of the property on which such taxes have been assessed as may be necessary<pb n="640" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="188" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>to identify such property, if the records of his office contain such description, which list shall be made out by counties. The list for each county shall contain the delinquent taxes assessed in such county, and due and payable in such county; also, the name of the person or persons, firm, corporation or association against whom such taxes are assessed, and from whom the same are due, if known; if not known, or such persons are non-residents of the State, these facts shall be stated; which said list shall be certified to be correct by the Comptroller, under his hand and the seal of his office; and the Comptroller shall immediately transmit such list to the sheriff of the proper county, with an order to seize and sell any personal property belonging to the delinquent tax payer that may be in his county subject to the payment of such tax, or so much thereof as may be necessary to pay such taxes, interests due on the same, and all costs and fees, for collec<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion; and such sale of personal property shall be regulated by the law governing the sale of similar property, as on execu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion. On the receipt of such list and order from the Comptroller by the sheriff, if there is no personal property in his county out of which such taxes can be collected, then such sheriff shall deliver such list and order to the clerk of the District Court of his county, who shall file the same; and if the description of the landed estate in such list is not sufficient to identify the same, the sheriff, if possible, shall procure such description as will identify the same, certify un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />der his hand to-the correctness of the same, deliver it to the clerk of the District Court, who shall file the same, and when so filed, it shall become a part of the list forwarded by the Comptroller. So soon as the list and necessary de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />scription, as herein required, are filed in the office of the district clerk, he shall docket as a sepe[a]rate case the amount of taxes assessed and due from each person, firm, corporation or association, in the name of the State of Texas, against such person, firm, corporation or association. If the owner of the land against which such taxes or any part of them are assessed is unknown, the style of the case shall be &#8220;The State of Texas v. An unknown tax payer.&#8221; So soon as such cases are docketed by the dis<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />trict clerk, he shall at once issue a citation to such person or persons, firm, corporation or association, who may be known, and resident of this State, naming them by the<pb n="641" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="189" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>name or style by which such delinquent taxes appear to be assessed against them, and which citation shall state the ag<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />gregate amount of tax and interest shown to be due by the list on file, and shall command them to apppear and show cause, if any they can, why the State of Texas should not re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cover judgment for such tax and interest, and sell the real estate on which the said taxes or any part of the same were assessed, to pay said taxes, and all costs of this proceeding. It shall be directed to the sheriff or other lawful officer of the county where the list on file shows such delinquent tax payer to reside, and may be served by reading the same to the de<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />fendant or defendants, or by leaving a certified copy of the same at the residence or principal place of business of such defendant; and service on one of two or more delinquent tax payers, or any one member of a firm, or officer or stock<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />holder of a corporation, or any one member of any associa<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion, shall be full and complete service under this act to bring all of the defendants to court. And the endorsement on said citation by the sheriff or other officer of &#8220;executed,&#8221; with the date of execution under the hand of the sheriff or other lawful officer, shall be prima facie evidence of full and complete service under this act. In case the delinquents are unknown, or the sheriff or other lawful officer has re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turned a citation &#8220;not found or not known to be in my county,&#8221; then, in any or all of these cases, the district clerk shall issue a citation, incorporating in said citation the num<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ber and style of each case on his docket at the time in which it is not provided in this act that personal service must be had, stating the amount of tax and interest claimed in each case, as appears by the list on file, the name of delinquent, if known, his place of residence, if known, or that it is un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />known, commanding such delinquents, or any person inter<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ested in the lands on which such taxes are assessed, to ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pear, and show cause why the State of Texas should not have judgment for such taxes, interest and all costs of proceedings, and decree for sale of the real estate on which said taxes, or any portion of them, are assessed, to pay the same; which said citation shall be directed to the sheriff of the county or other law<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ful officer where said cases are: pending, with an order that he cause a certified copy of the same to be published in some<pb n="642" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="190" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>newspaper published in said county, for three successive weeks before return day of same; if there be no paper pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished in the county, then to be published for the same time in the nearest newspaper published out of the county. The sheriff or other lawful officer shall endorse on said original citation &#8220;executed in accordance with law, prior to return day,&#8221; and sign the same officially, and such return shall be prima facie evidence of full and complete service under this act. If the period of publication is not complete by the re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />turn day mentioned in said writ, the sheriff may return the same to the next term, and such service shall be good for such term; and the district clerk shall proceed from time to time in this manner, to obtain service from all the cases on the docket of his court, required to be made by publication, including in the same citation all cases ready and requiring such mode of service in the same citation. The court shall allow a just and reasonable fee for publishing each citation, to be taxed in the bill of costs, and to be apportioned be<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tween the several cases included in such citation, in such manner as may be just and equitable. At the first term of the court after service is perfected under the provisions if this act, on the fifth day of such term, such tax cases shall stand ready for trial, and no pleadings on the part of the State shall be necessary, further than the filing of the list aforesaid; and such list, and the additional descriptive list, which may be filed by the sheriff under this act, shall be prima facie evidence of all of the facts therein stated. The defendant, in his plea, shall only be permitted to call in question, first, the constitutionality or legality of the taxes sought to be collected, or any of them; second, that all or a portion of said taxes have been paid. Any person in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terested in the lands sought to be subjected to the payment of the taxes may, by proper plea, make himself a party, and make the same issues as are here permitted to be made by the delinquent himself. On the issue of the payment of the taxes, defendant shall be entitled to a jury, if demanded. The sheriff shall certify on said list before he files the same with the district clerk, that he knows of no personal prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty in his county out of which he can make the taxes due.</p>
<p>Sec. 2. The judgment of the court, if for the State, shall be for the amount of taxes shown to be due, all in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />terest on same, and for all costs of suit, and it shall be<pb n="643" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="191" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>stated in such, judgment what amount of such taxes is due the State, and what amount due the county, and shall further contain such description of the real estate on which such taxes have been assessed as shall be sufficient to identify the same; also, an order that in consideration of its appear<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing to the court that the taxes adjudged in favor of the State, or State and county, have been assessed on said lands, or are a lien on the same, or that said lands are subject to payment on same, that so much of the same be sold in man<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ner and form as is required by law in case of sale of real estate on execution, as may be necessary to pay the judgment here rendered, and all costs. If the judgment of the court is against the State, the costs shall be adjudged against the State and county respectively, in proportion to the amount of taxes claimed by each. The cost bill or amount to be paid by the State, certified to by the district clerk, under his hand and seal, and approved by the district judge, shall be sufficient authority for the Comptroller to draw his war<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />rant on the Treasury for the amount in favor of the sheriff, who, when he collects said warrant, shall be officially respon<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sible to the clerk and other parties for their portion of such cost bill paid by the State; the County Court shall audit and pay the amount due from the county. Ho case under this act shall be continued by either party more than one time. The district attorney shall in all cases under this act represent the State, and in all contested cases, if the State recover, a fee shall be taxed against the defendant of five dollars for the use of the district attorney.</p>
<p>Sec. 3. In all sales of real estate under this act, if the tract contains more than forty (40) acres, the sheriff shall designate a particular corner of such tract, as a commencing point for the land sold, and the sheriff shall state the propo<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sition of sale bidders, first, in this form: &#8220;Who will take the least number of acres out of the first forty acre tract, and pay the taxes and costs adjudged?&#8221; If a less number than forty, or the forty acres is not accepted, then the sheriff shall offer such forty acre tract to the highest bidder. If the sale of the first tract does not satisfy the execution, then, for the balance due, the sheriff shall offer the second forty acre tract, and proceed with it in the same manner as the first, and so on till the execution is satisfied, or the land ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />hausted. This shall not apply to any lots in a town or<pb n="644" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="192" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>city which, shall be offered for sale as a whole. Execution, or an order of sale, shall issue and be directed to the sheriff as is required by law in such cases, and shall be executed in accordance with the law regulating the sale of real estate on execution, when not changed by this act. The sheriff shall offer the land for sale in forty acre tracts or less, to be taken as near in a square form as may be convenient or prac<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tical, considering the shape of the tract of land from which they are taken; and shall deliver to the purchaser, on the payment of the money, a deed, which shall contain such description as shall identify the land, if the entire tract is included in such deed; if only a portion of the tract is in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cluded, then a general description of the entire tract, suffi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cient to identify it, with a description of the portion sold, so that it can be identified and separated from the remainder of the tract unsold; and such deed shall be prima facie evi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dence of perfect title to the land included in all the courts of this State; and such deed shall fully authorize the party to have such land surveyed and set apart by the county sur<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />veyor; and the field notes made by the county surveyor, un<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />der such deed, at the request of the grantee in such deed, or his vendee, shall be prima facie evidence in any court in this State. Any party or person interested in land sold for taxes, may, at any time within twelve months after the day of sale, redeem said land by paying to the purchaser, or to his as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />signees or vendee, the full amount of the purchase money paid for said land at said tax sale, with one years&#8217; interest on same at the rate of twenty per cent, per annum. After the expiration of said twelve months said land can not be redeemed, and the title of the purchaser, his assignee or ven<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />dee, acquired by virtue of such tax sale, shall not be im<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />peached or called in question in any of the courts of this State for any cause antecedent to the judgement.</p>
<p>Sec. 4. If there are no bidders for the land ordered to be sold in any particular case, such facts shall be stated in the return of the execution; and the sheriff shall, by virtue of the same execution, advertise the same for sale once in each six months thereafter till the taxes due by said judgment, and all accruing unpaid taxes, are paid and satisfied, or the land sold, making due return of his action on said execution each time. An extra fee of three ($3) dollars shall be taxed in favor of the sheriff, in<pb n="645" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="193" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>each, case, for the additional descriptive list it may be neces<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sary for him to file under this act. He shall account for all taxes collected under this act, as required by law for other taxes; and the comptroller shall charge the sheriff with the amount of taxes due the State and county, as shown by the list he forwards him, and all interest on same. The payment to the sheriff of the taxes due, interest, and all the cost in<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />curred up to date in the proceeding, at any time before the sale of the land, shall operate as a dismissal of the proceeding. If the defendant is dissatisfied with the judgment, he shall have the right of appeal to the Supreme Court, by a com<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pliance with the law regulating appeals from the  District to the Supreme Court. The State shall have the right to ap<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />peal to the Supreme Court, simply by giving notice in open court of such appeal, which said notice the district judge shall cause to be entered on the minutes of the court. The Comptroller shall be entitled to an additional clerk at a sal<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ary of sixteen ($1600) hundred dollars per annum, whose duty it shall be to get up and make out lists of delinquent taxes under this act.</p>
