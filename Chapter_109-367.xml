The omission of the name of any owner, or any mistake respecting the same, shall not invalidate the sale, of the property to be otherwise described with sufficient certainty, the proceedings may be stopped at any time upon pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment of said judgment to the collector.</p>
<p>Sec. 17. In all proceedings and advertisements for the collection of said taxes and assessments, and the sale of lands therefor, letters and figures may be used to denote lots, sub-lots, lands and blocks, sections, townships, ranges and parts thereof, the year and the amounts.</p>
<p>Sec. 18. The sale shall be made for the smallest proportion of ground (to be taken from the east side of the premises) for which any person will take the same, and pay the amount of judgment thereon, certificates of sale shall be made and subscribed by the col<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lector, which shall be delivered to the purchaser, which certificate shall contain the name of the purchaser, a description of the prem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ises sold, the amount of the tax or assessment, with the amount of the judgment for which the same was sold, and the time when the right to redeem will expire.

<p>Sec. 19. The person purchasing any lot or parcel of land, or other property, shall forthwith pay to the collector the amount of the judgment due thereon, and on failure to do so, the said property shall be again offered for sale in the same manner as if no sale had been made, and in no case shall the sale be closed until payment shall have been made. If no bid shall be made for any parcel of<pb n="275" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="165" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>land or other property, the same shall be struck off to the city, and thereupon the city shall receive in the corporate name, a certificate of the sale thereof, and shall be vested with the same rights as other purchasers at such sales.</p>
<p>Sec. 30. The collector shall make return of his precept to the court from which the same was issued; a record of all sales made by the collector shall be kept in the office of the city clerk, which shall be open to public inspection at all reasonable times, and said record or copies thereof certified by said city clerk, shall be deemed sufficient evidence to prove the sale of any land or other property for taxes or assessment or any other fact authorized to be recorded therein.</p>
<p>Sec. 21. The right of redemption in all cases of sales for taxes or assessments shall exist to the owner, his heirs, creditors or as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />signs, to the same extent as is allowed by law in the case of sales of real estate for taxes, on the payment in lawful money of the United State of double the amount for which the same was sold, and all taxes accruing subsequent to the sale with interest at the rate of ten per cent. per annum. If the real estate of any infant, feme covert or lunatic be sold under this act, the same may be redeemed at any time within one year after such disability shall be removed.
