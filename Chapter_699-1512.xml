And when said trustees are ready to purchase or pay off said bonds, or the said coupons, or any of them, the treasurer of said county shall pay to the order of said trustees, or any two of them, all of the funds which he may have in hand for said purposes except two and a half per cent, thereof, which he shall re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tain as fees.

The said coupons shall be receivable for any taxes assessed for county purposes, and the sinking fund shall be used in the purchase of the bonds herein named. In the month of June of each year, after the issuance of said bonds, the said trustees shall advertise, in a newspaper pub<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />lished in said county, that they will purchase or pay off, in the month of July following, such of said bonds as they may have funds to meet; and if any of said bonds are presented for payment, said trustees shall except<sup>1</sup> [accept] those that are offered at the lowest rate, and if none are presented, they shall draw from the whole number which may remain unpaid such numbers of said bonds as will make an amount equal to the amount of the funds then in the treasury, and advertise, as aforesaid, for one month, that they are ready to pay off said bonds drawn as aforesaid; and if said bonds are presented, they shall pay the same; and if they are not presented, they shall cease to bear interest, and the coupons thereto attached shall not there<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />after be paid.

Ten cents costs shall be taxed to each lot against which judgment is rendered, five cents to be for fees, and five cents for advertising the notice of sale.</p>
<p>Sec. 59. It shall be the duty of the clerk of such court, within twenty days after such order is granted as afore<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />said, to make out, under the seal of said court, a copy of so much of said collector&#8217;s report in such case as gives a descrip<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion of the land or other property against which judgment shall have been rendered, and the amount of such judgment, together with the order of the court therein, which shall constitute the process on which all lands, lots, sub-lots, pieces and parcels of land or other property shall be sold for the amount of any taxes, assessments, damages and costs so levied, assessed or charged upon them; and the said city collector is hereby expressly authorized and empowered to make sale of such land, lots, pieces or parcels of land or other property upon two days&#8217; notice, to be published at least three times in some newspaper printed in said city.</p>
<p>Sec. 60. That said advertisement, so to be published in each case of a judgment upon any special or general collection warrant and report as aforesaid, shall contain a list of the delinquent lots and parcels of land, or other property to be sold; the names of the owners, if known, the amount of the judgment rendered thereon, respectively, and the warrant upon which the same was rendered, the court which pronounced the judgment, and a notice that the same will be exposed to public sale, at a time and place to be named in said advertisement by said collector. The omission of the name of any owner, or any mistake respecting the same, shall not invalidate the sale, if the property be other<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />wise described with sufficient certainty. The proceedings may be stopped at any time upon payment of said judgment to the collector.</p>
<p>Sec. 61. In all proceedings and advertisements for the<pb n="1217" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="517" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>collection of said taxes and assessments, and the sale of lands therefor, letters and figures may be used to denote lots, sub-lots, lands and blocks, sections, townships, ranges and parts thereof, the year and the amounts.</p>
<p>Sec. 62. The sale shall be made for the smallest proportion of ground (to be taken from the east side of the premises), for which any person will take the same, and pay the amount of judgment thereon; certificates of sale shall be made and subscribed by the collector, which shall be delivered to the purchaser, which certificate shall contain the name of the purchaser, a description of the premises sold, the amount of the taxes or assessments, with the amount of the judgment for which the same was sold, and the time when the right to redeem will expire. The collector shall continue such sale from day to clay, until all the lots or parcels of land, or other property contained in his precept, on which judgment remains unpaid, shall be sold or offered for sale.</p>
<p>Sec. 63. The person purchasing any lot or parcel of land, or other property, shall forthwith pay to the collector the amount of the judgment due thereon, and on failure to do so, the said property shall be again offered for sale in the same manner as if no sale had been made, and in no case shall the sale be closed until payment shall have been made. If no bid shall be made for any parcel of land or other property, the same shall be struck off to the city, and thereupon the city shall receive, in the corporate name, a certificate of the sale thereof, and shall be vested with the same rights as other purchasers at such sales.</p>
<p>Sec. 64. The collector shall make return of his precept to the court from which the same was issued; a record of all sales made by the collector shall be kept in the office of the city clerk, which shall be open to public inspection at all reasonable times; and said record, or copies thereof, certified by said city clerk, shall be deemed sufficient evidence to prove the sale of any land or other property for taxes or assessment, or any other fact authorized to be recorded therein.</p>
<p>Sec. 65. The right of redemption in all cases of sales for taxes or assessments shall exist to the owner, his heirs, creditors or assigns, to the same extent as in allowed by law in the case of sales of real estates for taxes, on the pay<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ment in lawful money of the United States of double the<pb n="1218" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="518" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>amount for which the same was sold, and all taxes accruing subsequent to the sale, with interest at the rate of ten per cent. per annum. If the real estate of any infant, feme covert, or lunatic, be sold under this act, the same may be redeemed at any time within one year after such disability shall be re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />moved.</p>
<p>Sec. 66. Redemption shall be made by the payment of the amount of redemption money to the treasurer, and taking his voucher therefor, and filing the same in the office of the city clerk, who shall thereupon note the fact of said redemp<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tion upon his record of sales, or any person holding a certifi<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />cate of sale may surrender the same to the city clerk to be can<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />celed, and the fact shall in like manner be noted upon said record, upon the return of the certificate, or proof of its loss, and the filing with the city clerk of the affidavit required by the Constitution of this State. If the property shall not have been redeemed according to law, a deed shall be executed to the purchaser, or his assignees, under the corporate seal, signed by the mayor and clerk, conveying to such purchaser or assignee the premises so sold and unredeemed as aforesaid. A memorandum of all deeds so made and delivered shall be entered by the city clerk in the book wherein tax sales are re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />corded, and a fee of one dollar may be charged by the city clerk for every deed so issued.</p>
<p>Sec. 67. Such certificate of purchase shall be assignable by endorsement, and an assignment thereof shall vest in the assignee, or his legal representatives, all the right and title of the original purchaser.</p>
<p>Sec. 68. Whenever it shall appear to the satisfaction of the city clerk, before the execution of a deed for any prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty sold for taxes, that such property was not subject to taxation, or that the taxes had been paid previous to the sale, he shall make an entry opposite to such property, on his record of sales, that the same was sold in error; and such entry shall be evidence of the fact therein stated; and this provision shall apply, so far as is applicable, to all sales for special assessment.</p>
<p>Sec. 69. All deeds made to purchasers of lots, lands, or other property sold for taxes or assessments, shall be prima facie evidence in all controversies and suits, in relation to the right of the purchaser, his or her heirs or assigns, to the premises thereby conveyed, of the following facts:</p>
<pb n="1219" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="519" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>

<p>Second&#8212;That the taxes or assessments were not paid at any time before the sale.</p>
<p>Third&#8212;That the land or lot conveyed had not been re<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />deemed from the sale at the date of the deed; and shall be conclusive evidence of the facts&#8212;</p>
<p>Fourth&#8212;That the land or lot was sold for taxes or assess<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ments, as stated in the deed.</p>
<p>Fifth&#8212;That the land or lot was advertised for sale in the manner and for the length of time required by law.</p>
<p>Sixth&#8212;That the grantee in the deed was the purchaser. That the sale was conducted in the manner required by law. And in all controversies and suits, involving the title to the lot or land claimed and held under and by virtue of such deed, the person or persons claiming title adverse to the title conveyed by such deed shall be required to prove, in order to defeat the said title, either that the land or lot was not subject to taxation at the date of sale; that the taxes or assessments had been paid; that the land or lot had never been listed and assessed for taxation or assessment, or that the same had been redeemed according to the provisions of this act, and that such redemption was made for the use and benefit of the persons having the right of redemption under the laws of this State; but no person shall be permitted to question the title acquired by said deed without first showing that he, she or they, or the person under whom he, she or they claim title, had title to the land or lot at the time of the sale, or that the title was obtained from the United States or this State, after the sale, and that all taxes due upon the lot or land have been paid by such person, or the person under whom he claims title as aforesaid; and no deed of land, or other property sold for the non-payment of taxes or assessments, shall be questioned in any suit or controversy, unless the person wishing to contest the same shall have tendered or deposited the amount of the redemption money and interest, as now provided by the laws of this State in case of sales of real estate for taxes.</p>
<p>Sec. 70. Any changes made in the incumbent of the office of the collector during the pendency of any such proceedings shall not operate to affect or delay the same,<pb n="1220" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="520" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>but the successor or successors in office of such collector shall be authorized to do all acts necessary to complete such proceedings, the same as if his predecessor had con<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />tinued in office. In case of a vacancy occurring in any such office, the proceedings shall be prosecuted by the mayor until such vacancy is filled.</p>
<p>Sec. 71. All sales of property for the non-payment of taxes and assessments for any improvement of whatever kind soever, shall be held at the same time with the general sale of property for non-payment of city taxes in each year, unless in particular cases said sale is stayed or delayed by examination or process of law; the intent thereof being that there shall be but one general collection by sale of all taxes and assessments whatsoever, in each and every year, which sale shall take place in the manner hereinbefore provided, and at the same time in each year; provided, that in all cases where judgment should be delayed in consequence of any appeal, or the delay of any court in rendering its decision, such sales may be made at any time after final pudgment shall have been rendered, upon notice to be given [as] in other cases.</p>
<p>Sec. 72. Any assessor, collector, or other officer, who shall in any case refuse, or knowingly neglect to perform any duty enjoined upon him by this act, shall, for every such neglect or refusal, be liable to said city individually, and upon his official bond, for double the amount of loss or damage caused by such neglect or refusal, to be recovered in an action of debt, in any court having jurisdiction of the amount thereof.</p>
<p>Sec. 73. If any purchaser of lands, lots or other prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty, sold for city taxes or assessments, shall suffer the same to be again sold for like taxes or assessments, before the ex<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />piration of two years from the date of his or her purchase, such purchaser shall not be entitled to a deed for the prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty until the expiration of two years from the date of the second sale, during which time the land, lot, or other prop<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />erty, shall be subject to redemption, and the person redeem<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />ing shall only be required to pay for the use of the purchaser, at the first sale, the amount paid for the property, and double the amount paid by the second purchaser for his use, as in other cases.</p>
<p>Sec. 74. In all cases where there is no agreement to the contrary, the owner or landlord, and not the occu<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />pant or tenant, shall be deemed the person who ought to<pb n="1221" ed="gammelslawsoftexas" /><pb ed="unknown" n="521" /><fw type="header" place="top">Laws of the State of Texas.</fw>bear and pay every charge or assessment made for the expense of any public improvement. When any such charge or as<pc force="weak">-</pc><lb break="no" />sessment shall be made upon or paid by any person, when, by agreement or by law, the same ought to be borne or paid by any other person, it shall be lawful for one so paying to sue for and recover of the person bound to pay the same, the amount so paid, with interest; or he may retain and deduct the same from any rent due or to become due to such person. Nothing herein contained shall impair or in any way affect any agreement between any landlord and tenant, or other persons, respecting the payment of such assessment.</p>
<p>Sec. 75.
